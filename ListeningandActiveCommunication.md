A vital communication ability is active listening, which entails paying close attention, comprehending what the other person is saying, responding, and keeping it in mind. Being present, sympathetic, and involved in the discourse go beyond only hearing what is said. Following are six techniques for active listening:

1. Give Your Full Attention: Put away all other activities and concentrate entirely on the speaker. Maintain eye contact, refrain from interjecting, and don't prepare your response while the other person is speaking. Demonstrate a sincere interest in what they have to say.

2. Empathetic Understanding: Put yourself in the speaker's shoes and try to comprehend their perspective to demonstrate empathy and understanding. By nodding or using phrases like "I get it" or "That must have been hard," you can express your understanding of their thoughts and feelings.

3. Use Verbal and Nonverbal Encouragement: Encourage the speaker to keep talking by using words like "yes," "go on," or "tell me more." To demonstrate interest and openness, use the proper facial expressions and body language.

4. Reflection: Consider and then summarise or paraphrase what was stated to show that you were paying attention after the speaker finished speaking. This not only demonstrates understanding but also gives the chance to clear up any ambiguities.

5. Ask Open-Ended Questions: Encourage deeper discussion by posing open-ended questions that invite the speaker to go into more detail about their ideas and emotions. Asking questions that could hinder dialogue should be avoided.

6. Suspend Judgement: Be open-minded and refrain from drawing hasty or erroneous conclusions. To completely hear the speaker's viewpoint, active listening entails putting prejudices and preconceived ideas aside.

The important points can be summed up as follows using Fisher's paradigm of reflective listening:

1. Empathetic Engagement: Reflective listening entails engaging with the speaker actively in a way that exhibits empathy and understanding. It seeks to emotionally engage with the speaker in addition to merely hearing the words.

2. Mirroring Body Language and Emotions: This style places a strong emphasis on the value of reflecting the body language and emotions of the speaker. By doing this, the listener shows real interest in what the speaker is saying and supports their feelings.

3. Verifying the Message: Verifying the message that was conveyed by the speaker is a part of reflective listening. To make sure that the speaker's words are understood correctly and to prevent misunderstandings, this may entail paraphrasing or summarising them.

4. Creating a Safe Setting: Fisher's paradigm emphasises the need of providing the speaker with a secure and judgment-free setting. This promotes direct and honest communication, especially in difficult or emotionally sensitive circumstances.

Although there are many other barriers to hearing, the following are some typical difficulties:

1. Distractions: Outside variables that can detract attention and prevent active listening include noise, interruptions, and digital devices.

2. Prejudice & Bias: Having preconceived ideas or biases regarding the speaker or the subject matter might make it difficult to listen with objectivity and an open mind.

3. Lack of Empathy: The inability to understand the speaker's feelings or viewpoint can result in misunderstandings and a lack of sincere connection.

4. Information Overload: A listener may become overwhelmed by too much information or complicated talks, which makes it difficult for them to comprehend and remember the information.

5. Selective Listening: Limiting one's attention to particular details or excluding information that doesn't support previous notions can prevent one from fully absorbing what is being said.

6. Physical Barriers: It may be challenging to accurately hear and understand the message due to hearing loss or a language barrier.

7. Mind Wandering: Internal reflections and private issues may cause a lack of focus and diminished attention to the speaker.

8. Defensive Listening: Being defensive or expecting to disagree might make it difficult to be receptive and open to other viewpoints.

9. Multitasking: Trying to multitask while listening can result in split attention and poor comprehension of the talk.

10. Lack of Feedback: Failure to ask questions or provide the speaker feedback may lead to misconceptions or poor communication.

People may adopt a passive communication style in a variety of circumstances, including:

- Avoiding Conflict: People may become inactive and hold back on expressing their genuine thoughts or opinions when they desire to avoid conflict or arguments.
- Seeking Approval: Some people may conceal their own wants or desires in an effort to win the approval of others or to please them.
- Feeling intimidated: Some people may choose a passive communication style to shield themselves from potential confrontation when dealing with dominating or aggressive personalities.
- Lack of Confidence: People with low self-esteem or confidence may opt for a passive strategy out of a fear that their ideas or opinions won't be acknowledged or valued.
- Fear of Rejection: People may avoid situations out of fear of rejection or other unfavourable outcomes.

People may switch to aggressive communication styles in various situations, such as:

- Feeling Threatened: People may act violently as a defence mechanism to protect themselves when they feel threatened, attacked, or challenged.
- Strong emotions of irritation or anger might cause people to communicate aggressively because they may lash out or become confrontational.
- Power Struggles: Some people may use aggressive communication to assert themselves in situations where there is a power struggle or competition for supremacy.
- Inability to regulate Emotions: In some circumstances, inability to regulate one's emotions and impulses might result in aggressive behaviour.
- Need for Control: People who have a strong need to influence others or take control of a situation may communicate aggressively to attain what they want.
- Reacting to Past Trauma: As a coping mechanism, aggressive communication can occasionally be sparked by the memory of past trauma or unresolved concerns.

People may switch to passive-aggressive communication styles in various situations, such as:

- Expression of Frustration: People who are irritated or upset may use sarcasm, insults, or passive-aggressive humour to cover up their feelings.
- Avoiding Confrontation: Some people could give someone the silent treatment or refrain from using their direct voice in order to avoid conflicts or awkward conversations.
- Gossiping as a technique of venting: Gossiping about people or disclosing unfavourable information can be a passive-aggressive way to voice dissatisfaction or annoyance.
- Getting Back at Others: Individuals may utilise subtle actions or behaviours to get back at others or retaliate instead of coming at them head-on.
- Feeling Powerless: When someone feels helpless or unable to exert themselves directly, they may communicate in a passive-aggressive manner.
- Passive-aggressive speech is sometimes used by people to hide their genuine feelings or to avoid showing them.


- Be Direct and Clear: Without being combative or passive, convey your wants and opinions in a clear and concise manner. To express your feelings and opinions in a forceful manner, use "I" expressions.

- Active Listening: Pay attention to what others are saying and accept their points of view, even if you don't agree with them. To encourage frank discussion, give insightful responses.

- Respect Personal Boundaries: Remain aware of your own boundaries and refrain from pushing your opinions on others. Observe their freedom to express a different opinion.

- Use assertive body language: To support your assertive communication, keep acceptable eye contact, stand or sit with confidence, and make the appropriate movements.
