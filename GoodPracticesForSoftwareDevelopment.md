Question 1
What is your one major takeaway from each one of the 6 sections. So 6 points in total.
Getting requirements from the team: Be careful to collect precise and explicit requirements from the team. Get frequent feedback during the implementation process if the requirements are ambiguous.
Never undercommunicate: Keep your staff informed constantly, even if it's just to let them know what's happening. Keep your video on in meetings and use group chat channels rather than private DMs.
Stuck? Pose inquiries: Ask succinct, lucid inquiries that make it simple for someone to assist you when you're stuck. Use code snippets, pictures, and screenshots to illustrate your problem.
Get to know your coworkers: Spend some time learning about your coworkers' work schedules. You'll be able to communicate more effectively as a result.
Observe and respect your teammates: Be considerate of the time and availability of your team members. Avoid spamming them with texts, and make yourself reachable if they have any questions.
putting all of your effort into something: Give your work your undivided concentration when you're doing it. You'll be able to focus and be more effective as a result.

Question 2
Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
Practise asking a friend or myself questions aloud. This will make it easier for me to practise asking questions that are precise and to the point.
Learn how to ask better questions by reading articles and books.
Pay attention to other people's question-asking style and take note of their examples.
I try to think of a couple other ways to phrase the same question when I'm stumped. This will enable me to formulate the inquiry in a clear and succinct manner.
Be patient, and if you're unsure of how to phrase a question, don't be hesitant to ask for assistance.
