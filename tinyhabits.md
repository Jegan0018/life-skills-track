"Forget big change, start with a tiny habit" by BJ Fogg:

- Cue, routine, and reward are the three components that make up a habit. 
- Make it simple to develop a new habit by starting small with something achievable daily.

- Behavior change formula: B = MAP (Behavior = Motivation, Ability, Prompt).
- Increase motivation, ability, or prompt to alter behavior.
- Visualization boosts drive; accountability partners enhance motivation.
- Simplify behavior for better ability.
- Clear plans and structures (processes) assist in maintaining habits even when motivation wanes.

## Question 3 [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_8e-6ZHKLs)
### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?

The B = MAP formula can make forming new habits easier by focusing on:

- **Motivation**: Visualizing desired outcomes and finding accountability partners.
- **Ability**: Simplifying the habit through easy steps or breaking it down.
- **Prompt**: Associating the habit with existing routines and using habit trackers.

## Question 4 [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_8e-6ZHKLs)
### Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating successful habit completion is important because it:

- Boosts motivation and reinforces the habit.
- Enhances habit enjoyment and satisfaction.
- Increases self-confidence and a sense of achievement.
- Creates a positive feedback loop for continuous improvement.

### Your Takeaways from the Video (Minimum 5 points)

- Habits are the self-improvement equivalent of compound interest.
- Small, consistent changes compound into significant outcomes.
- Start small, build on successes for lasting change.
- Clear, appealing, and fulfilling habits are key.
- Celebrating accomplishments reinforces habits.

## Question 6
### Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?

- **Identity**: Seeing oneself as the type of person who does a habit regularly supports maintaining behavior. E.g., envisioning oneself as a healthy individual to ease dietary and fitness goals.
- **Processes**: Establishing routines and structures aids habit maintenance. E.g., designating a writing time daily for better writing even when motivation is low.
- **Results**: Focusing on desired outcomes helps maintain motivation. E.g., setting a weight loss goal to stay on track.

## Question 7
### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier?

- **Make it clear**: Simplify habits for easier initiation. E.g., designate a spot to meditate for an easy daily practice.
- **Make it appealing**: Find enjoyable aspects of habits. E.g., partner up for workouts to enhance enjoyment.
- **Make it fulfilling**: Celebrate and reward after completing habits. E.g., treat yourself to a new book for meeting reading goals.

## Question 8
### Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?

- **Reduce its obviousness**: Make harmful habits less accessible. E.g., keep junk food out of sight.
- **Make it less appealing**: Diminish satisfaction from negative behavior. E.g., use substitutes like nicotine patches to quit smoking.
- **Lessen the satisfaction**: Disconnect bad habits from rewards. E.g., avoid entertainment until work is done to combat procrastination.

## Question 9
### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I aim to develop the habit of regular meditation. To achieve this:

- **Cue**: Set a specific time and place for meditation, e.g., right after waking up. Place a meditation cushion or chair by the bed as a visual reminder.
- **Attractive**: Create a calming environment with scents and lighting. Make it appealing for a peaceful experience.
- **Ease**: Begin with short sessions, using guided meditation apps. Gradually increase duration.
- **Satisfying**: Keep a meditation journal to track progress and feelings. Acknowledge accomplishments for satisfaction.

## Question 10
### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I intend to reduce excessive smartphone use. Strategies to achieve this are:

- **Invisible Cue**: Store the phone out of sight, perhaps in a designated drawer.
- **Unattractive Process**: Disable non-essential notifications, move distracting apps to inaccessible screens.
- **Hard Process**: Set screen time limits, use app blockers, and complicate unlocking (e.g., with complex passwords).
- **Unsatisfying Response**: Reflect on time wasted due to phone use, creating a negative association.
