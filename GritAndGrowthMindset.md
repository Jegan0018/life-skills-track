## Question 1

In the video, Angela Duckworth, a psychologist who studies grit, argues that grit is more important than IQ for success in many areas of life. She defines grit as "the passion and perseverance for long-term goals."

Duckworth supports her claim with research showing that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate from high school and college, and they were also more likely to succeed in their careers. She also found that grit was more important than IQ for predicting success in the military.

Duckworth argues that grit is important because it helps people to overcome challenges and setbacks. Gritty people are more likely to stick with their goals even when things get tough. They are also more likely to learn from their mistakes and to keep trying until they succeed.

The video concludes by arguing that grit can be learned and developed. Duckworth offers some tips for developing grit, such as setting challenging goals, breaking down goals into smaller steps, and finding a supportive community.
